# Programmazione Agile

- Focusing on short term less likely to make wrong Irreversible decisions
- Specifying written rules, behaviours, & policies for maintaining alignment of activities
- Flexible and adaptive to different situations
- Boundaries between plans and processes blur plans are enacted via practices which are part of development process
- Agile planning is not for projects with long term perspectives
- Focusing on short-term issues could lead to suboptimal decisions made
  
Agile planning deals with more complex single issues than traditional planning However, agile planning has less issues to handle
In general, agile planning requires less effort
#### Stand-up meeting
- Everyone stands -> avoiding lengthy discussions
- Coordination among developers
- Setting a stage to discuss hard problems
- Organizing the daily development
	- Meeting occurs at the beginning of each day
	- Informing each other of previous day’s progress
	- Assigning code to develop for the day
#### Measuring velocity
- Measuring the situation against the goal
	- Help programmers to stay focused
	- To gain insight about progress of activities
- Measuring every single activity is not feasible
	- Too much overhead
### Requisiti

Verifying a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is important:
- SRS guides the rest of software development
- SRS can act as a contract between customers and developers
Projects with a lot of changes
- Costly to produce a verifiable SRS
- Agile requirements elicitation is a wiser choice

**Requirements are**
- High-level, short written statements with best available information
- Frequent, personal interactions with customers
- Frequent delivery of software to customers
- Feature: a short phrase describing what customer wants
	- eg. Feature-Driven Development & Scrum methodologies
- User story: eg. XP
  
Oltre ai requisiti funzionali ci sono
- Non-functional requirements
	- Customers’ usability, reliability, availability, performance needs, etc.
- Technical requirements
	- devices, OSs, ...
- Security and privacy issues
- User story cards are often augmented with listings of the above requirements and constraints
